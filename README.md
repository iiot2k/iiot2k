If you like my work and find it helpful, please support me with buy me a coffee.

### Libraries for the Raspberry Pi
The libraries are written in JavaScript and TypeScript for Node.js.<br>
For performance reasons, the hardware accesses are written as an addon in C++.<br>
Due to time constraints, I only support the 64 bit version of the Raspberry Pi operating system.<br>
The libraries can be installed from the npm package manager.<br>

The following libraries exist:<br>

>Raspberry Pi gpio library (on work)<br>
